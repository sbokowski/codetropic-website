      <h1>Characters that can be used in JavaScript</h1>
      <p>1, letters,(a,b c)) 2. numbers (1,2. 3) symbols (!, @, #)</p>
      <p>and escape characters \'</p>
      <h1>Strings</h1>
      <p>'Hello' is a string / string equals some text</p>
      <h2>combining a string</h2>
      <p>'some' + 'text' + 'here'</p>
      <p>Concatenation (combining strrings together)</p>
      <h1>Rounding a number off in JavaScript</h1>
      <p>
        Rounding is taking a 2.2 / number and round it to nearest whole / number
      </p>
      <p>
        Use Math.round(2.4) which will round of to 2 , Math.round(2.5) will
        round off to 3
      </p>
      <h1>Math.round()</h1>
      <h2>Try it</h2>
      <p>
        console.log(Math.round(0.9)); // Expected output: 1
        console.log(Math.round(5.95), Math.round(5.5), Math.round(5.05)); //
        Expected output: 6 6 5 console.log(Math.round(-5.05), Math.round(-5.5),
        Math.round(-5.95)); // Expected output: -5 -5 -6
      </p>
      <p>Math.round((2095 + 799) * 0.1) will give you 289</p>
      <h1>In programming</h1>
      <p>2, 3, 4 are called integers</p>
      <p>2.2 , 2.5 are called floating points numbers (floats)</p>
      <p>Computers have a problem working with floats</p>
      <p>
        the reason is this for example 0.1 + 0.2 = will return a value of
        0.30000000000000004

      <h1>We can use (... )</h1>
      <p>to control which part gets done first</p>
      <h1>Order of operation</h1>
      <p>* multiply / division are done first</p>
      <p>+ - addition and subtract are done aftter</p>
      <h1>Error</h1>
      <p>Uncaught SyntaxError: unexpected token: string literal</p>
      <h1>Syntax</h1>
      <p>- Rules that we have to follow when using a programming language.</p>
      <p>- In Programming, we have to follow the Rules of syntax exactlyu</p>
      <p>- similar to English (grammar)</p>
      <h1>What is JavaScript</h1>
      <p>
        Javascript is one of the care technologies of the web, along side Html
        ,CSS
      </p>
      <p>
        Its a high level, interpreted programming that can be used on the client
        side as well as the server side with Node.js
      </p>
      <h1>What is Javascript used for?</h1>
      <p>DOM (document object model) Manipulation</p>
    </div>

    <h1>const keyword</h1>
    <p>
      In JavaScript, const is a keyword used to declare a variable that cannot
      be reassigned a new value. It is similar to let
    </p>
    <h1>Selectors</h1>
    <p>
      What is a JavaScript selector? In JavaScript, selectors can be used to
      select elements in the DOM. A selector can be an element ID, class, or tag
      name such as document. querySelector('#my-id') . Here is an example of
      using a selector in JavaScript to select an element with an ID of 'my-id'.
    </p>
    <h1>Event listener</h1>
    <p>
      Events are things that happen in the system you are programming, which the
      system tells you about so your code can react to them. For example, if the
      user clicks a button on a webpage, you might want to react to that action
      by displaying an information box.
    </p>
    <h1>Functions</h1>
    <p>
      A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedureâ€”a set of statements
      that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify
      as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there
      is some obvious relationship between the input and the output.
